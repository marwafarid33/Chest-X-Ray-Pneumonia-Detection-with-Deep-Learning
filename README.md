# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray using CNN (TensorFlow / Keras)

This project uses Deep Learning (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be identified through chest X-rays.  
In this project, we build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect pneumonia from grayscale X-ray images.  
We use data augmentation, batch normalization, and learning rate scheduling to improve performance.
